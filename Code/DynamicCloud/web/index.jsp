                      A secure data storage of cloud computing is presented of a data auditing scheme. Auditing is a refinement of checking the user data which can be done by the data owner or by a TPA. The integrity of stored data on the cloud serves to maintain it. The TPA manage is split into two: one is private audibility, which allows the data owner can analyze the integrity of the data. No one has the authority to inquire about the server considering the data. Though it attains to increases verification overhead of the user. Second is public audibility, the confidentiality of the data can check by only TPA. The behalf of the client can act TPA so TPA is an entity. The verification of integrity has handled to appropriate work that all essential expertise, capabilities, knowledge and professional skill and the position of the client is also reduced by it. It should be crucial that TPA should efficiently or frequently audit the cloud data storage without requesting for the local copy of data.

                      It uses AES256, RSA-15360, and SHA512 algorithm. AES-256 is a standard and most acceptable algorithm for encryption and decryption processes. It works on the input block size of 128 bits having a key size of 256 bits. Therefore, it has 2256 possible a key combination which is 78 digits number. It exponentially generates the number of astronomically in the observable universe. It is considered a strong algorithm among all. If a computer breaks 1 trillion decryption/seconds then it has taken 257year to break the AES-256. It is more secure than RSA and ECC.

                      SHA-512 algorithm was developed by NIST. It is a member of SHA-2 which is the latest version of the secure hash algorithm based on the Merkle-Damgard scheme. Ron Rivest has invented this algorithm that uses a one-way hash function. The previous algorithms SHA0, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA384 developed this algorithm. The SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and, SHA512 are made by NIST of as the new standard hash function. SHA512 is a development of SHA1 which is an MD4 based improvement. The reliability of SHA512 is chieved by the ability to generate 512 bits hash value, This long hash value makes the SHA-512 more resistant to attack than any other hash function so sha512 is considered a powerful, robust and fast hash function ability to generate 512 bits hash value, which is the longest hash value that a hash function can generate. This long hash value makes the SHA-512 more resistant to attack than any other hash function so SHA512 is considered a powerful, robust and fast hash function.
